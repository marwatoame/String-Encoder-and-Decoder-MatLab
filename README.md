# String-Encoder-and-Decoder-MatLab
This project is divided into two sections, string encoding and string decoding
1. String Encoder: this part is to implement and test an English alphabet character voice-frequency encoder and to generate a waveform representing the whole string after encoding it.
2. String Decoder:  this part is to implement and test a decoder for the system in part one, which can recover the text string from the encoded multi-frequency signal.
